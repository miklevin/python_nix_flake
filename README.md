A modern, reproducible Python development environment using Nix Flakes and `uv` for fast dependency management and virtual environments. This flake replaces traditional `pip` and `virtualenv` with `uv`, streamlining setup across Linux, macOS, and Windows (via WSL), with optional CUDA support. Perfect for AI projects, data science, or any Python workflow needing JupyterLab and beyond. Features specialized shells optimized for both human developers and AI assistants.

## Features

- **Cross-Platform**: Works on Linux, macOS, and Windows (WSL) with a single `flake.nix`.
- **Fast Setup**: Uses `uv` for quicker virtual environment creation and dependency installation.
- **Reproducible**: Nix ensures consistent environments across machines.
- **JupyterLab Ready**: Launch JupyterLab with `start` and stop it with `stop`.
- **CUDA Support**: Auto-detects and configures CUDA on Linux if available.
- **Customizable**: Add your Python dependencies in `requirements.txt`.
- **AI-Optimized**: Multiple shell configurations for different use cases:
  - Interactive shell with full banners and feedback for humans
  - Quiet shell with minimal output for AI assistants and automation

## Want More Detail?

If you're looking for a more comprehensive guide with detailed explanations, check out the original pip-oriented version at [https://github.com/miklevin/darwinix](https://github.com/miklevin/darwinix). That repository goes into much more detail about the concepts and setup process. This `uv`-based version assumes you know what you're doing and want a streamlined, modern approach.

## Prerequisites

- [Nix](https://nixos.org/download.html) installed with Flake support enabled.
- A `requirements.txt` file (optional, see example below).

## Quick Start

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/miklevin/python_nix_flake.git
   cd python_nix_flake
   ```

2. **Enter the Development Shell**:
   
   For human interactive use with welcome messages and ASCII art banner:
   ```bash
   nix develop
   ```
   
   For AI assistants or automation (minimal output):
   ```bash
   nix develop .#quiet
   ```
   
   Both shells set up the virtual environment with `uv` and install dependencies from `requirements.txt`.

3. **Start JupyterLab**:
   ```bash
   start
   ```
   Opens JupyterLab in your default browser at `http://localhost:8888`. Use `tmux attach -t jupyter` to view the server logs.

4. **Stop JupyterLab**:
   ```bash
   stop
   ```

## Example `requirements.txt`

Here's a sample to get you started with data science and AI tools:

```
httpx
jupyter-ai[all]
jupyterlab
nbstripout
numpy
pandas
requests
```

## Why UV?

- **Speed**: Significantly faster than `pip` and `virtualenv`.
- **Simplicity**: Combines venv creation and package management in one tool.
- **Trendy**: Adopted by cutting-edge AI projects like MCP and OpenManus.

## Structure

- `flake.nix`: Defines the Nix Flake with `uv`-powered Python environment.
- `requirements.txt`: Your Python dependencies (customize as needed).
- `.gitignore`: Ignores `flake.lock` and `.venv` for clean commits.

## Customization

- **Add Packages**: Edit `requirements.txt` and re-run `nix develop`.
- **CUDA**: Automatically enabled on Linux if `nvidia-smi` is detected.
- **OS-Specific Tweaks**: The flake adapts to Linux or macOS automatically.

## Working with AI Assistants

The flake provides specialized support for AI coding assistants through the `.#quiet` shell:

### Benefits for AI Tools

- **Clean Output**: Eliminates verbose banners and messages that consume limited context windows
- **Enhanced Visibility**: Makes error messages and diagnostics easier to identify
- **Resource Efficiency**: Perfect for automated workflows, CI/CD pipelines, and AI-driven tasks

### Recommended Command Pattern

When using AI assistants, use this pattern for predictable output:

```bash
cd ~/repos/python_nix_flake && pkill -f "<process_pattern>" || true && nix develop .#quiet --command bash -c "<your_command>"
```

For example, to run a Python script with clean output:

```bash
cd ~/repos/python_nix_flake && nix develop .#quiet --command python my_script.py
```

Or to check installed packages:

```bash
cd ~/repos/python_nix_flake && nix develop .#quiet --command bash -c "pip list | grep numpy"
```

This approach ensures AI tools get exactly the information they need without unnecessary clutter.

## Troubleshooting

- **No browser tab?** Visit `http://localhost:8888` manually.
- **Dependency errors?** Check `requirements.txt` syntax or run `uv pip install -r requirements.txt` manually inside the shell.
- **CUDA not working?** Ensure NVIDIA drivers and `nvidia-smi` are installed.
